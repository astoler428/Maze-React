Applied the disjoint set data structure to create a maze app that allows the user to create a custom sized random maze and print it out.
I first created the project in HTML, CSS and Javascript and then adapted it into React.js.
I realize that it's not a very reactive application, but I wanted to practice my React.js skills, hence why I used useReducer, even though it was not necessary. I looked for places to practice.

The majority of the work on the project was done on the master branch. There you can find the html, css, javascript version, too.
