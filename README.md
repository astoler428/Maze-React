Applied the disjoint set data structure to create a maze app that allows the user to create a custom sized random maze and print it out.
I first created the project in HTML, CSS and Javascript and then adapted it into React.js.
I realize that it's not a very reactive application, but I wanted to practice my react skills.
That is why I also used useReducer, even though it was not necessary.
